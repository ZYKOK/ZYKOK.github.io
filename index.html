    <h2 class="gs_reveal">Website Overview</h2>
    <p class="gs_reveal">This website is developed to provide the public with clear, 
        accessible insights into road safety trends across Australia. This platform presents official data on road fatalities 
        and injuries through interactive charts and maps, allowing users to explore patterns by location, age, gender, and vehicle type. 
        By making this information easily understandable, the website aims to promote transparency, raise awareness of key risk factors, 
        and support evidence-based initiatives to improve road safety nationwide.</p>

      <h3 class="gs_reveal">Number of Fatalities by <span>States in Australia</span></h3>
      <p class="gs_reveal">This interactive heatmap visualizes the number of road fatalities across Australian states in Australia. 
        The color intensity of each state represents the number of fatalities, with darker shades indicating higher counts, 
        allowing you to quickly identify regions with elevated road safety risks.</p>
      <p class="gs_reveal"><strong>How to use:</strong> Hover over a state to see detailed fatality numbers for that location. 
        Click on any state to highlight it and the corresponding range on the legend, helping you compare the severity 
        relative to other states. Use the year slider above the map to filter the data and observe changes over time. 
        This interactivity allows you to explore trends geographically and temporally for better insights into regional road safety patterns. 
        The play button allows you to go though an animation of the fatalities through the years.</p>

            <h2 class="gs_reveal">Analysis</h2>
            <p class="gs_reveal">This choropleth map provides a geographic overview of road fatalities across Australian 
              states for the selected year. States with darker shades indicate higher numbers of fatalities, 
              while lighter shades indicate lower incidence. New South Wales and Victoria consistently 
              exhibit elevated fatality rates, likely due to their larger populations, high traffic density, 
              and extensive road networks. Queensland also shows a significant number of fatalities, 
              possibly linked to both urban and rural traffic risks. Smaller states and territories, 
              such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory, record fewer fatalities, which may reflect their 
              lower population density and traffic volume. By presenting the data geographically, 
              this visualisation highlights regional disparities in road safety, allowing policymakers and 
              transport authorities to prioritize interventions, allocate resources efficiently, and design 
              targeted safety campaigns where they are most needed. Moreover, trends observed over multiple 
              years can help identify whether interventions are effective in reducing fatalities in high-risk regions.</p>

      <h3 class="gs_reveal">Number of Hospitalisations by <span>Road Users in Australia</span></h3>
      <p class="gs_reveal">This interactive sunburst chart visualizes the distribution of road-related hospitalizations 
        across different road user categories in Australia from 2011 to 2021. The hierarchical structure allows you to 
        explore patterns by gender and age groups, revealing which demographics are most affected by 
        road incidents requiring hospitalization.</p>
      <p class="gs_reveal"><strong>How to use:</strong> Click on any segment to zoom in and explore that category in detail. 
        Click the center to zoom back out. Hover over segments to see detailed hospitalization numbers. 
        Use the filters below to add demographic breakdowns to your analysis.</p>

            <h2 class="gs_reveal">Analysis</h2>
            <p class="gs_reveal">The sunburst chart illustrates hospitalised injuries by road user categories, including car drivers, 
              motorcyclists, pedestrians, and other classifications. Users can filter the data by gender or age group, 
              enabling a detailed exploration of risk patterns among different demographics. The chart reveals that 
              certain groups, such as middle age and male road users, experience a higher proportion of injuries, 
              which may correlate with risk-taking behaviors, higher exposure to traffic, or other socio-behavioral 
              factors. The aggregate toggle provides a broader view of the relative contributions of each road user 
              category to hospitalisations, emphasizing the distribution of injuries across the population. Such 
              insights are valuable for targeted policy development, public education campaigns, and road safety programs. 
              For instance, interventions could focus on high-risk groups identified by age or gender, while 
              infrastructure improvements could be prioritized in areas with higher car driver or motorcyclist injuries. 
              This visualisation thus helps stakeholders understand the multidimensional nature of road injuries beyond fatality statistics.</p>

      <h3 class="gs_reveal">Seasonal Trends <span>Dashboard</span></h3>
      <p class="gs_reveal">This interactive dashboard provides a multi-layered view of road-related incidents in Australia, enabling users 
        to explore how incident patterns change across years, months, days of the week, and times of day. The dashboard 
        aggregates data from 2000 to 2025, offering both high-level trends and detailed temporal insights to support road 
        safety analysis and decision-making.</p>
      <p class="gs_reveal">The four coordinated visualisations reveal complementary aspects of incident behaviour: a yearly bar chart highlights 
        long-term trends; a monthly line chart shows seasonal variations; a day-of-week bar chart uncovers weekly behavioural 
        patterns; and a time-of-day scatterplot exposes peak times for incident occurrences.</p>
      <p class="gs_reveal"><strong>How to use:</strong> Click any bar in the yearly incidents chart to filter the entire dashboard by that specific 
        year. All charts will update automatically. Use the dropdown menu to select a year manually or click the reset button to 
        return to the full dataset. Hover over any point or bar to view detailed incident counts.</p>

          <h2 class="gs_reveal">Analysis</h2>
            <p class="gs_reveal">The seasonal trends dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of temporal patterns in road fatalities and injuries across Australia. 
              The line chart shows fluctuations in fatalities by month, highlighting periods with higher risk, often coinciding with holiday seasons, 
              extreme weather conditions, or increased travel. The day-of-week chart further identifies trends, showing that weekends and public 
              holidays typically have elevated fatality rates, likely due to increased recreational travel and alcohol-related incidents. The scatterplot 
              displays incidents by time of day (0000h-2359h), revealing peak periods such as evening traffic hours. Additionally, the year-based
              bar chart enables comparisons across years to identify trends and evaluate the impact of safety interventions over time. Collectively, 
              these visualisations support evidence-based decision-making by highlighting high-risk periods and groups, enabling authorities to adjust 
              traffic enforcement, road safety campaigns, and public awareness initiatives to reduce fatalities and hospitalisations.</p>
